# Travel-Converter
### Introduction
'Traveling in different countries or continents comes with challenges. One of them is the convertion of values and sizes. This is exactly where the Travel-Converter comes into play. The Travel-Converter aims to simplify travelling by having an all-in-one-converter.
### Considerations
'Mexiko and the United States of America are popular travel destinations of Europeans and vice versa. Therefore the values and sizes of these countries where choosen to be the first getting implemented in this project. However, there is the possibility of expanding the project to include other countries'
'Values that are going to be converted in this project include currencies, temperature, length units and sizes. A distinction is made between male and female sizes. Furthermore, there is a subdivision into shoe sizes, dress sizes and trouser sizes.'
'Another consideration that needs to be made is whether the values and sizes are determined by calculations or assignments and which values must be included in the programme and which must be requested by the user.'
